  - Repository: https://github.com/ftnext/sphinx-new-tab-link
  - Documentation: https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-new-tab-link/

## Installation
To install TeachBooks-Favourites, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Install the Package**

Install the `teachbooks-favourites` package using `pip`:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/TeachBooks/TeachBooks-Favourites
```

**Step 2: Add to `requirements.txt`**

Make sure that the package is included in your project's `requirements.txt` to track the dependency:
```
git+https://github.com/TeachBooks/TeachBooks-Favourites
```

**Step 3: Enable in `_config.yml`**

In your `_config.yml` file, add the extension to the list of Sphinx extra extensions (**important**: underscore, not dash this time):
```
sphinx: 
    extra_extensions:
        - teachbooks_favourites
```

## Usage

For using the various packages we refer to the different manuals linked above.

All extensions are loaded with their default settings.

## Configuration

By default, all extensions in TeachBooks-Favourites are activated. You can customise which extensions are loaded by setting either `teachbooks_favourites_include` **or** `teachbooks_favourites_exclude` in your `_config.yml`. Setting both at the same time will raise an error.

### Exclude specific extensions

Use `teachbooks_favourites_exclude` to disable one or more extensions while keeping all others. For example, to disable the tippy hover-over feature:

```yaml
sphinx:
  config:
    teachbooks_favourites_exclude:
      - teachbooks_sphinx_tippy
```

### Include only specific extensions

Use `teachbooks_favourites_include` to activate only the extensions you need, disabling everything else:

```yaml
sphinx:
  config:
    teachbooks_favourites_include:
      - sphinx_exercise
      - sphinx_proof
      - sphinx.ext.todo
```

The extension names to use are the `Extension name` values listed for each extension in the introduction above.
